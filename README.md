Duckling UMT
============

UMT stands for User Management Tool.

All jars that can not be obtained from the public maven repository
have been put into *'localdep'* directory, so you need to install them
into your local repository manually (install-dep.sh) before building.

The 'umt.war' could be made by 'mvn package'.

Please check 'Install.txt' for how to deploy and config (in Chinese).
