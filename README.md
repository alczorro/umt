Duckling UMT
============

User Management tools

All jars that can not be obtained from the public maven repository
have been put into *'localdep'* directory, so you need to install them
into your local repository manually (install-dep.sh) before building.

Pom.xml has been rewritten.
More tests and adjustment of configs will be done.
